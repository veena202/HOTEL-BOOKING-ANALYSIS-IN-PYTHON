Hello everyone. Today, Iâ€™ll present an analysis focused on understanding high cancellation rates in both City Hotels and Resort Hotels. This is critical as cancellations impact revenue and room utilization, and our goal is to provide actionable recommendations for minimizing cancellations and optimizing bookings."

Dataset Overview
We worked with a dataset of over 99,000 records and 36 columns, capturing details like hotel type, booking status, lead time, and average daily rate (ADR). Key data preparation steps included handling missing values in columns like children, agent, and company, addressing outliers in lead time and ADR, and ensuring consistent formatting across fields."

Research Questions
"Our analysis aims to answer:

What factors influence hotel booking cancellations?
How can we reduce these cancellations?
How can hotels improve pricing and promotions based on these insights?"
Key Findings

High Cancellation Rates: "The data shows that over 40,000 bookings were canceled, raising concerns about issues like overbooking or customer dissatisfaction. This prompted further analysis of lead time, room type, and booking channels to identify patterns linked to cancellations."

Hotel Preference: "City Hotels received significantly more bookings than Resort Hotels, likely due to their appeal for business travelers or urban tourists. This suggests that location and purpose of stay are key factors in booking choices."

ADR Trends: "We observed that the Average Daily Rate for City Hotels remains stable, while ADR for Resort Hotels fluctuates. This may be due to seasonal demand variations at Resort Hotels, as opposed to the steady demand from business travelers at City Hotels."

Monthly Reservation Levels: "August has the highest number of both confirmed and canceled reservations, suggesting peak booking activity. January, however, experiences the most cancellations relative to reservations, possibly due to price sensitivity during off-peak periods."

ADR and Cancellations: "Higher ADR months show increased cancellations, indicating that price sensitivity impacts booking retention. This points to an opportunity to explore flexible pricing to reduce cancellations."

Top Countries for Cancellations: "Guests from Portugal, the UK, and Spain had the highest cancellation rates, suggesting regional factors may play a role. Future strategies could tailor booking conditions for these regions."

Booking Channels: "Around 47% of bookings come from online travel agencies, 27% from group bookings, and only 4% from direct in-person bookings. This highlights the importance of online platforms in reaching guests."

Conclusion
"In summary, our analysis shows that cancellation rates are influenced by ADR, booking channels, and seasonality. Implementing targeted pricing strategies and tailoring promotions based on these insights can help reduce cancellations and improve hotel revenue. Thank you, and I welcome any questions."
